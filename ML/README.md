Surfed the internet and found this nice collection of neural-nets resources [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/), in spite of that they are pretty `OLD`(Last-modified: 2002-**), they seems high quality and self contained. Great chances are that we can find these info in a new textbook and some of contents here can be outdated, but I really think it fancy to translate a series of book-like articles.
